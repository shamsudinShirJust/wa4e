<h1>Assignment: Software Installation and Configuration</h1>
<p>
In this assignment you will install software that will be used during the course.  
This software includes a programming text editor and a PHP and MySQL Environment.  
Also as part of this assignment you will learn how to take screenshots and make them 
into images.  The deliverables of this assignment are two peer-graded images of 
your running software.
</p><p>
If you follow the instructions carefully and look at the handouts and watch the podcasts, 
this assignment should be pretty straightforward and take less than an hour.
</p><p>
<b>Note:</b> As you install on Windows, you may be asked for permission to open ports or 
to allow an application through the firewall - say 'yes' to these dialog 
boxes if they are popping up when you first install or first start your PHP environment.
</p>
<p>
If you get stuck on this assignment - feel free to get assistance from anyone who can help.
All we want is that you have successfully installed the software and can use it 
on your system.  This is not intended as a difficult or challenging assignment.
</p>
<h2>Resources</h2>

You should practice taking a few screen shots on your computer and saving them as PNG or JPG files.

<h2>Specifications</h2>
Go to www.wa4e.com and work through the installation guide and take the 
following steps.  There are sample screen shots.
<ul>
<li>
Install a programming text editor if you don't already have one.  I recommend 
Atom, but you can use NotePad++ (Windows) or TextWrangler (Macintosh).  You 
can use any editor you like but TextEdit (Mac), NotePad(Win), and Microsoft 
Word at *not* acceptable as program editors. 
</li><li>
I suggest XAMPP for Windows and MAMP for Macintosh.  They all function 
very similar.   But all the course examples will be with MAMP and the 
course staff will be most familiar with problem arising when you use 
MAMP so if you choose another environment you should be prepared to do 
your own tech support.
</li>
<li>
Navigate to the <b>phpMyAdmin</b> application select the "SQL" tab and type
<pre>
SELECT 'January 3, 2017'
</pre>
Substituting the date you are taking the screen shot, press the "GO" 
button and then take a screen shot of the resulting page.
</li>
<li>
Following the instructions in the installation documents, make sure that 
<b>display_errors = On</b> in your php.ini file.  Make the screen shot
to show you did it as follows:
<ul>
<li>For MAMP, go to the phpinfo page 
in your environment and scroll down until you can take a screen shot 
showing that your php.ini is correct and take a screen shot
</li>
<li>For XAMPP, go to Apache / Config and open the php.ini file and scroll
down to show that <b>display_errors = On</b> and take a screen shot.
</li>
<li>For Linux, use any editor to open your php.ini file and take a screen
shot showing <b>display_errors = On</b>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Turn those two screen shots in the peer-graded assignment in CTools.
</p>
<h2>Sample Screen Shots</h2>
<p>
The first screen shot for the peer-graded portion of the assignment 
is the <b>phpMyAdmin</b> as follows:
<center>
<a href="02-Select-Date.png" target="_blank">
<img src="02-Select-Date.png" width="80%"></a>
</center>
Don't worry about having fewer databases on the left hand side in your screen
shot since you just finished installing your server.
</p>
<p>
Here a sample of the 
second screen shot in the peer-graded portion is to verify that <b>display_errors</b> 
is <b>On</b> in your PHP configuration:
<center>
<a href="03-Errors-On.png" target="_blank">
<img src="03-Errors-On.png" width="80%"></a>
</center>
</p>
<p>
Here is a sample of a screenshot if you are using XAMPP:
<center>
<a href="04-XAMPP-On.png" target="_blank">
<img src="04-XAMPP-On.png" width="80%"></a>
